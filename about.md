Welcome to my about me. Currently, I work as a Research Engineer in applied AI. Which is what I want to stay in for the next decade at least. As I'm passionate about automating tasks, so that humanity steps closer to being 'free'. Which leads me to my views which econamically are in the social-capitalist area and philosophically I'm part of effective altruism. Except that I'm also a practitioner of Brazilian Jiu-Jitus which I'm a purple belt in.

I made this website to host my blog, resume and other interests such as projects. I've left my info in the footer so feel free to contact me.
